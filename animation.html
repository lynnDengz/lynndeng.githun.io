        <h4>My animation project, “The Orphan of Zhao,” is a retelling of a classic Chinese story that explores themes
            of revenge,
            sacrifice, and redemption. Through the use of animation, I aimed to bring this ancient tale to life in a
            modern context,
            making it accessible to audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

            In creating this project, I drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including traditional Chinese art
            and
            storytelling techniques, as well as contemporary animation styles. I paid particular attention to the
            details of
            character design, movement, and composition, seeking to create a rich and immersive world that would
            captivate viewers
            and draw them into the story.

            Ultimately, my goal with “The Orphan of Zhao” was to create a work of art that would not only entertain and
            educate, but
            also inspire reflection and discussion about the universal human experiences that the story portrays.
            Through the use of
            animation, I believe that I was able to convey the emotional depth and complexity of the characters and
            their
            relationships, inviting viewers to connect with them on a deeper level and engage with the story in a
            meaningful way.</h4>
