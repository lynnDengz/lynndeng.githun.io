        <h4>
            <P>My work is rooted in the idea of using light and shadow as sculptures, transforming commonplace objects
                into
                abstract
                art. I am fascinated by the ephemeral nature of light and how it can be used to create evocative
                images.<br><br>


                To achieve this, I experimented with different light sources and background textures, including LED
                lights,
                flashlights,
                sunlight, and city lights, as well as white walls, wallpaper, door/floor, and textured paper. I also
                played
                with
                composition and angle to create a series of images that capture the interplay between light and
                shadow.<br><br>

                The theme-based approach of the frameworks was instrumental in my development as an artist. I chose to
                explore the
                concept of “exploring light and shadow” inspired by Francesca Woodman’s work, which provided a guiding
                principle for my
                experimentation.<br>

                Through my work, I aim to transcend the traditional idea of a photograph as a mere image by capturing
                the
                ephemeral
                qualities of light and creating something abstract and sculptural. By displaying a series of images in
                exhibitions, I
                hope to expand the concept of two-dimensional photographic art and inspire viewers to see light and
                shadow
                in a new way.
